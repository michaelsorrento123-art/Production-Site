    <h1>Module 11: Press Release Exercise</h1>

    <h2>Part 1: Opening Paragraph</h2>

    <p>
      On <strong>Wednesday, February 5, 2026, from 3:00 to 4:30 p.m.</strong>, a group of philosophy students will be meeting in 
      <strong>Scott Library, Room 305 at York University</strong> for a casual midterm study session. The goal of the meetup is to go over 
      recent lecture material, compare notes, and help each other understand concepts that might still be confusing. With the midterm 
      coming up soon, this session gives students a chance to ask questions and get organized while there is still time to improve their 
      study plan.
    </p>

    <h2>Part 2: Press Release Outline</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Why this is happening now:</strong> The midterm is coming up, and students want to review before it’s too late.</li>
      <li><strong>Background:</strong> The study session was organized by classmates who realized others were struggling with the same material.</li>
      <li><strong>What to expect:</strong> Open discussion, reviewing key ideas, and working through possible exam questions together.</li>
      <li><strong>Quote:</strong> A short comment from one of the students about how studying together makes the material less stressful.</li>
      <li><strong>Logistics:</strong> Who should come, what to bring (notes, readings), and how long the session will last.</li>
      <li><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Shows how peer support can help students feel more confident and prepared.</li>
    </ul>
