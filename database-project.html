<h1>Database Project</h1>

<p>
This project explores how raw CSV data can be organized into a relational
database and queried to better understand customer activity, events,
and ticket sales.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>
The dataset provided for this project consists of three CSV files that
represent a small ticketing system. Each file contains information about
a different part of the system.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Customers</strong> – individuals purchasing tickets</li>
  <li><strong>Shows</strong> – events available for purchase</li>
  <li><strong>Orders</strong> – transactions connecting customers to shows</li>
</ul>

<p>
Rather than working with these files as separate spreadsheets, the data
was combined into a relational database so that relationships between
customers, shows, and orders could be clearly defined and queried.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Database Design</h2>

<p>
The database was designed using three tables: Customers, Shows, and Orders.
Each table has a primary key, and the Orders table uses foreign keys to
reference both customers and shows.
</p>

<p>
This structure creates two one-to-many relationships:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>One customer can place many orders</li>
  <li>One show can appear in many orders</li>
</ul>

<p>
This design reduces data duplication and allows information to be
retrieved efficiently using joins.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Analytical Questions</h2>

<p>
To demonstrate how the database can be queried, the following questions
were explored:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which shows generated the most revenue?</li>
  <li>Which customers spent the most on tickets?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>SQL Queries</h2>

<h3>Revenue by Show</h3>

<pre><code>
SELECT 
  s.title,
  SUM(o.qty * o.price) AS total_revenue
FROM Orders o
JOIN Shows s ON o.show_id = s.show_id
GROUP BY s.title
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
</code></pre>

<h3>Top Customers by Spending</h3>

<pre><code>
SELECT 
  c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name AS customer_name,
  SUM(o.qty * o.price) AS total_spent
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Results Summary</h2>

<p>
The results show clear differences in both show popularity and customer
spending. Some shows generated significantly more revenue than others,
and a small number of customers accounted for a large portion of total
ticket sales.
</p>

<p>
These queries demonstrate how a relational database can be used to extract
meaningful insights from structured data.
</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Process (Proof)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Downloaded and reviewed the provided CSV files.</li>
  <li>Identified entities and relationships within the data.</li>
  <li>Designed a relational schema with primary and foreign keys.</li>
  <li>Created the database using SQLite.</li>
  <li>Imported the CSV data into the appropriate tables.</li>
  <li>Validated relationships and record counts.</li>
  <li>Executed SQL queries to analyze ticket sales and revenue.</li>
</ol>

The original CSV datasets provided for the assignment were used as the source
data and are included separately.
