  <h1>Database Project</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates how a relational database can be used to store and analyze
    ticket purchasing data. The database was created using LibreOffice Base and structured
    to model real-world relationships between customers, orders, and shows.
  </p>

  <h2>Process (Proof of Work)</h2>
  <p>The database was created and tested using the following steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      A new LibreOffice Base database file was created.
    </li>
    <li>
      Three tables were uploaded with all of the raw data from eclass:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Customers</strong> – stores customer information such as first and last name</li>
        <li><strong>Orders</strong> – stores ticket purchases including price and quantity</li>
        <li><strong>Shows</strong> – stores show details such as title</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Relationships were created so that each order is linked to a customer and a show.
    </li>
    <li>
      The provided data was entered into the tables.
    </li>
    <li>
      A query was created to filter for <strong>Julie Briggs</strong> and display all of her ticket purchases.
    </li>
    <li>
      The total amount paid was calculated by multiplying price by quantity for each order
      and summing the results.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Query Evidence</h2>
  <p>
    The screenshot below shows the query results for Julie Briggs. It displays two orders:
    one ticket priced at $10 and two tickets priced at $10 each.

  <h2>Working Files</h2>
  <p>
    The LibreOffice Base database file used for this project is included below:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="3135 Data Base Project.odb" download>
        Download Database File (3135 Data Base Project.odb)
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Answer</h2>
  <p class="answer">
